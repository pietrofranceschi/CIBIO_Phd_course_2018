# Brute Force Statistical Testing 

Measurements made on Egyptian skulls from five epochs.

* epoch: the epoch the skull as assigned to, a factor with levels c4000BC c3300BC, c1850BC, c200BC, and cAD150, where the years are only given approximately, of course.
* mb:  maximum breaths of the skull.
* bh: basibregmatic heights of the skull.
* bl: basialiveolar length of the skull.
* nh: nasal heights of the skull.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("images/skulls.png")
```



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
skulls <- read_csv("data/skulls.csv")
head(skulls)
```


Let's visualize the characteristics as a function of the year

```{r}
skulls %>% 
  mutate(epoch = factor(epoch, levels = c("c4000BC", "c3300BC", "c1850BC","c200BC","cAD150"))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-epoch) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = epoch, y = value)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=median, geom="line", aes(group=name), col  ="red")  + 
  stat_summary(fun.y=median, geom="point", size = 2, col = "red") +  
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free") +
  theme_light()
  
  
```


Let's focus on mb. Is there a significant difference between 4000BC and 150AD?

```{r}
## Here we subset the dataset

data <- skulls %>% 
  select(epoch,mb) %>% 
  filter(epoch %in% c("c4000BC","cAD150"))
```


The strategy:
* the statistics we calculate is the different between the means of the two groups (d)
* H0: the skulls are not different 
* to construct the **empirical** distribution of d under the null hypothesis we shuffle the `epoch` label 5000 times (i.e. we assign each skull randomly to the epoch preserving class imbalance)
* we calculate how many times we obtain a d bigger than the observed one ... the proportion of this number will be the _empirical p-value_


```{r}
## this is the "real" d
d <- mean(data$mb[data$epoch == "cAD150"]) - mean(data$mb[data$epoch == "c4000BC"])

## let's perform the permutation
ds <- rep(0,5000)

for (i in 1:5000){
  mb_r <- sample(data$mb)
  ds[i] <- mean(mb_r[data$epoch == "cAD150"]) - mean(mb_r[data$epoch == "c4000BC"])
}

```


Now we plot the results ...

```{r}
hist(ds, col = "steelblue", breaks = 40, xlim = c(-6,6))
abline(v = d, col = "red", lty = 2)
```

* the histogram shows the empirical distribution of the 500 differences
* as one can expect, the distribution is centered around zero and fairly symmetric
* the red line shows the value of _d_

To calculate the empirical p-value we need to calculate how many times we get a d larger than the observed one under H0

```{r}
emp_p <- length(which(ds > d))/5000

emp_p
```


The results is significant at the 0.01 level of confidence

**Notes**

* The proposed procedure is non parametric and completely assumption free
* With a low number of samples the possible permutation could be limited
* With a lower number of samples parametric test (as the t-test) would have bigger power
